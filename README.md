# Python Roguelike TCOD Template

This is a *reasonable-defaults* template for roguelikes written using [python-tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) and [tcod-ecs](https://github.com/HexDecimal/python-tcod-ecs). It uses YAML files to describe game data and a pushdown-automata as a basis for the game engine. Meant to be hacked for the needs of your game. 

The Python environment can be quickly bootstrapped with `.\bootstrap.bat` (Windows) or `.\bootstrap.sh` (Linux).

With no changes, this should produce a working demo. The character can be moved with WASD, Numpad-8426, or arrow keys.
